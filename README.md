# EchoLocation: AI-Powered Notion Management

## Project Overview

EchoLocation is a Python application that leverages CrewAI and LangChain to create an AI assistant for managing Notion workspaces. The app integrates with the Notion API, allowing AI agents to create and modify Notes, Knowledge Base articles, and Tasks within Notion databases based on natural language conversations with the user.

## Features
